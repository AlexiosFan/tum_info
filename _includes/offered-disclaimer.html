  This is a list of elective modules grouped by area with availability data, which as far as Vuenc knows is not provided by TUM elsewhere. I hope it will be helpful to you!

  This site is non-official and automatically generated by fetching the data from the curriculum tree view and the data from the Courses tab in TUM online, and merging
  it based on the course identifiers. It can contain errors, for example if
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a course is missing the course identifier (INxxxx etc.) from its name</li>
  <li>a course was still missing from the tree view at the time of creation</li>
</ul>

title: "Improved scripts!"
---

Added a simpler way to contribute using the executable file ([Windows](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/raw/main/dist/Grades.exe)). Now you can generate a file with all your grades and send it over Telegram or any other of the communication channels listed in the app! Also broke scripts down to improve reusability.

Special thanks to Selman for submitting their grades. We now have **659 entries**!

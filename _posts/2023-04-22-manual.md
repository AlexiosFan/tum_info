title: "Added 109 courses!"
---

Hello, wonderful students of TUM! As I mentioned before, I've added all grade distributions from a [certain GitLab repo](https://gitlab.lrz.de/about1/informatics-courses) to the website:
[https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/).

Now there is a grand total of 109 easy to access grade distributions for your convenience.

> ⚠️ I'd like to ask the following. If you know any lists of grade distributions or have your own exam statistics, either send them to me or put them on the website yourself by creating a GitHub issue. ⚠️

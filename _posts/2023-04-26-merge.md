title: "Added 626 courses!"
---

Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center. With the new website update, we now have
ðŸŽŠ **[626 COURSES](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/)** ðŸŽ‰, most of which came from a similar project.

Also improved [the 404 page](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/404.html).

And a separate thank you to Orgest for making a contribution and improving the grade gathering script.
In the future, I'll try to split the schools into separate pages, as the list is getting a bit too long for my liking.

title: "Fixed languages!"
---

Reporting for duty! Added a few more grade distributions from course exam statistics. But mainly fixed languages for language courses - in the past every exam was in English by default.

If you see that one of the courses you took is not on the website, please submit it! You can check out how on the [ReadMe page](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/).

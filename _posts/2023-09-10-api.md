title: "Released the API!"
---

Top of the morning to you ladies! You asked and I delivered.

An EPIC new website addition to all you thirsty developers is the public API. A short description for it
can be found on the [ReadMe page](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/). But in summary,
I added a [Description page](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/api/description) with documentation
for every available endpoint and a [Playground page](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/api/playground)
where you can test out your own code. All course and school data on the website is available in the API,
so you can write your custom scripts or programs referencing it.

And another call to the website visitors. As the semester is over, don't hesitate to contribute your grade distributions
to the website.

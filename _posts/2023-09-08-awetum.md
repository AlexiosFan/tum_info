title: "Added AweTUM!"
---

A beautiful day out here in Bavaria. And an exciting one, where a new major update came to the website!

First, I've added a new page to the website, [AweTUM](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/awetum/),
featuring links to useful study resources and hobby projects of TUM students. If you have anything to add,
just PM/DM me the link with a short description. I hope to make the website a central point for useful
unofficial TUM-related stuff, so any help from you is highly welcome.

Second, I reworked the apps to accept unknown schools, departments and course formats.
This means you can safely ask your friends from Management, Architecture or Biology to contribute their grades!

Don't forget that as the grades for the 2023SS have rolled out, you can contribute them here!
For that, check out the instructions in the [ReadMe](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/).
Stay toasty!

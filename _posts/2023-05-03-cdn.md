title: "No more CDN!"

What is up, my fellow human beings!? This update of [the website](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/) fixes an issue that has been nagging me for ages. You know how you open a course and the plot loads a bit later? That's because I was using [a 3rd-party CDN hosting](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@observablehq/plot) for the js scripts that build the plot. Now I've made a copy (with proper copyright attribution) and store it with the other scripts on GitHub. The plots should show up faster and be easier to cache!

Separate thanks to Xavier George and Vuenc for contributing their grade statistics. We now have **652 entries**!

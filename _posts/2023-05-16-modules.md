title: "Added modules!"

Hey Twitter World! Itâ€™s Yours Truly. With the new update, the website now features a [Modules](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/modules/) section
with elective modules offered for different study programs. The data is fetched from the [repository by Vuenc](https://github.com/Vuenc/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures),
then gathered in one place and cross-linked with grade reports for your convenience. If you want to contribute something to the module pages
or can't find your program on the page, go to their repository and [file an issue](https://github.com/Vuenc/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/issues).

If you have any other ideas on what to put on the website, let me know!

title: "Improved scripts!"
---

Hi besties! I added a simpler way to contribute using the executable file ([Windows](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/releases/download/1.0.1/Grades.exe), [Linux](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/releases/download/1.0.1/Grades), [MacOS](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/releases/download/1.0.1/Grades.dmg)). You can find a video guide [here](https://youtu.be/nHjuVhIJRaQ). Now you can generate a file with all your grades and send it over Telegram or any other of the communication channels listed in the app! Also broke scripts down to improve reusability. Check [ReadMe](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/) for more detailed instructions.

Special thanks to Selman for submitting their grades. We now have **659 entries**!

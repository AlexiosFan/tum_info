title: "Added course reviews!"
---

Hello, Internet! Welcome to TUM Info.

A lot of students were complaining that grade reports are good, but don't offer feedback from actual students taking the course. This has changed! On the new design, you can click on a course on the courses or schools page, which will send you to a page with all reviews. For example, [Machine Learning](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/reviews/CIT/IN2064). The reviews are taken from the numerous chats created for study programs and specific courses.

If you have some free time, we are looking for volunteers to go through chat history and add it to the website. Contact us through the means listed [here](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/blob/87cd920fcb143dc31fa92d7e85c2fd9f1253ee73/scripts/course_glob_ui.py#L175).

title: "Contribute your grades!"
---

Hello again, hard-working excellence chasers! A quick update regarding the website.

1. You can now easily contribute your own grades. Just follow [instructions in the ReadMe](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/) to run a short script that gathers all your achievements and fix minor mistakes manually.
2. I've now manually added over 150 courses to the website, feel free to check them out!
3. I've updated the courses page to have links for each school for easier navigation.

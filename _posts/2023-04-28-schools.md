Sup you beautiful bastards! With the new website update, you can now check out the courses [per school/department/faculty](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/schools/).

The tables there are sortable and contain some useful info (thanks to Jan for the suggestion). The tables are a bit too big for mobile, but you can scroll them horizontally with your finger.

Also added the posts section with messages regarding website updates.

Thanks to Luca for contributing his grade reports! You can do so too by following [these instructions](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/).

Hi who knows good course in AWR?

- Did protein prediction 1, thats doable.
- Yeah, I also recommend this course if you just need credits.
- And to not always reduce Protein Prediction to the fact that you relatively easy get the 8 credits for AWR: If you have some interest for biology itâ€™s actually an interesting course and Prof. Rost is a motivated lecturer. I enjoyed the course.

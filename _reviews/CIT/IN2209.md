Hi, does anyone have some exams from the previous years in „IT-Sicherheit“? Unfortunately on unistuff there are no exams for this lecture👎🏼 

- I've attended one. The questions are rather precise. So study everything from the slides, know it by heart and then study some more and you should be golden.

Thx, but Prof. Eckert said that there are some exams somewhere in the internet😅 I couldn’t find them and thought someone could send them to me per pn 🙂

Does anybody know if attendance to exercise sessions in this course is mandatory in order to participate in the exam? Acccording to TUMOnline it is.

- No, it's not mandatory, that's outdated info, you can check the course page.

Ok. But did the professor mention anything about the organizatinal mattters such as: exam type, obligatory attendance, etc. Thanks ?

- Exams on the vision chair are usually oral only if there not more than 20-30 people taking it.
- Attendance not obligatory.

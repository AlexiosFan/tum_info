Who had " social computing " here? Could he/she notify me please? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I'm so concerned about exam!

- I did last summer. Donâ€™t worry too much, it was more than fair. If you want to go for the 1.0, spend the time and prepare all the sample questions at the end of the slides on your own (no collab doc where 10 people do the stuff). You will be well prepared then. The questions that are not from this list are usually still pretty close.<br/><br/>
Georg as the (valid) opinion that informatic students should be comfortable with a certain level of math, so he wonâ€™t spare you from it during the lecture and exercises. However there have been no derivations of the same level as those at the end of slides during the exam other than those that have been at the end of the slides.
- Similar story from friend: Study Slides well and easy to score 1.0 in Social Computing.

Thanks alot for the comprehensive answer, but I didn't get your conclusion about the maths questions. You're saying its difficulty will be the same as the ones at the end of the slides?

- There are some harder ones at the end of the slides, prepare these and expect that they might be asked for. But there havenâ€™t been others on the same level of difficulty he didnâ€™t give you explicitly the chance to prepare for.

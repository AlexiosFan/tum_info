The course is taught as a set of old lecture recordings and Q&A sessions. There is also a set of programming exercises and a group project filling a big percentage of the final grade. Both of them take a long time to complete and depend on the people you are paired with, which can lead to negative results. The grading also took about a month. The grades for programming exercises were released close to the final grade, rather than throughout the semester.

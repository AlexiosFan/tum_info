Overall a good course. The exam doesn't change year to year, so you can prepare using old sheets. The practical sessions help memorize solutions to different problems and every solution is further repeated during the lecture. Thus, by paying even a little attention, it is possible to pass the exam with a good grade. This course can't be assigned to the curriculum of Master's Informatics: Games Engineering students.
